5. Operational Blueprint
This section outlines the core operational strategy for trial execution.
5.1 The Patient Journey
A visual flowchart mapping the patient's entire path—from pre-screening to final follow-up—is
maintained in the Trial Master File (TMF). This map details:
Key Procedures: Pinpoints assessments (e.g., EORTC QLQ-C30, imaging) at each visit.
Data Deadlines: Specifies EDC entry deadlines to ensure data currency.
Patient Burden: Identifies long visits or complex procedures to help sites manage patient
experience and retention.
5.2 Global Site Strategy
Sites are tiered to focus resources and manage performance effectively:
Tier 1 (Anchor Sites | 5-7): High-enrolling centers (e.g., UCSF, MD Anderson) with dedicated
support to drive initial enrollment momentum.
Tier 2 (Contributing Sites | 10-12): Key academic and community centers in the US/EU providing
steady, consistent enrollment.
Tier 3 (Strategic Sites | 4-6): Asia-Pacific sites crucial for global submission data, receiving
specialized regional support for longer startup timelines.
5.3 Supply Chain & Logistics
Drug Supply:
Lumarex (Investigational Drug): Managed via a central depot strategy (US & EU hubs) using an
IVRS/IRT system for automated inventory management. Temperature excursion protocols are
mandatory.
Standard Chemotherapy (Comparator): Sourced centrally by the sponsor to ensure consistency
and quality and shipped with Lumarex.
Lab Kits & Sample Management:
Central Lab: [Vendor Name]
Sample Logistics: A clear process map defines sample handling from collection to shipping to
ensure integrity. Shipping windows and stability times are detailed in the Lab Manual.
6. Governance & Communication
This section defines roles, responsibilities, and communication channels.
6.1 Core Team & Decision Rights (RACI)
Principal Investigator: Dr. Susan Han (UCSF)
Sponsor: BioNova Therapeutics
CRO: ClinEdge Global
Data Management: Medidata Rave (EDC)
Safety Oversight: Independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
A detailed RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) chart clarifying decision
rights for protocol amendments, budget changes, and site issues is maintained in the TMF.
6.2 Meeting Cadence
Weekly Ops Meeting (Sponsor/CRO Leads): Tactical review of KPIs, site issues, and actions.
Bi-Weekly Governance Meeting (Sponsor/CRO Leadership): Strategic review of milestones,
risks, and budget.
Monthly Investigator Call: Share enrollment updates, best practices, and protocol clarifications.
Ad-Hoc DMC Meetings: Convened per the DMC charter to review safety data.
6.3 Critical Escalation Pathway
This flowchart defines the process for urgent issue resolution. Example: Potential Unblinding
Event
Site Staff: Immediately calls the 24/7 Medical Monitor hotline AND the assigned CRA.
CRA: Immediately notifies the CRO Project Manager and Safety Lead.
CRO Project Manager: Notifies the Sponsor Study Lead within 1 hour to launch a formal
investigation.
7. Proactive Risk Management
The following register identifies key risks and defines mitigation and contingency plans.
Reviewed bi-weekly.
| Risk Category | Specific Risk | Probability | Impact | Trigger (Early Warning) | Mitigation Plan
(Plan A) | Contingency Plan (Plan B) | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | | Regulatory | Delayed
IRB renewals at international sites. | High | High | Site reports upcoming expiry with no meeting
scheduled. | Proactive 90/60/30-day reminders from CRO; dedicated regional startup
specialists. | Escalate to sponsor leadership for direct institution outreach; prepare for temporary
enrollment hold at site. | | Safety | Delays in SAE reporting beyond 24 hours. | Medium | High |
Weekly SAE reconciliation report shows >24h lag. | Emphasize 24-hour rule at site initiation;
configure automated alerts from EDC to site staff. | Issue formal Letter of Clarification to PI;
conduct targeted re-training; place site on monitoring hold if persistent. | | Enrollment | Screen
failure rate exceeds 50% due to strict eligibility criteria. | Medium | High | Weekly enrollment
report shows a high Screen Failure (SF) to randomization ratio. | Analyze SF reasons weekly;
provide targeted training to sites on inclusion/exclusion nuances. | Propose protocol amendment
to broaden criteria if scientifically sound; activate pre-identified "rescue" sites. | | Supply Chain |
Shortage of comparator chemotherapy agent. | Medium | High | Vendor or sites report low local
stock levels. | Implement dual-sourcing strategy for comparator; maintain central emergency
stock at depots. | Notify regulatory bodies of shortage; amend protocol to allow an alternative
standard chemo if appropriate. |
8. Quick Reference Guide for Site Staff
8.1 Visit Schedule Summary
| Visit | Timing | Key Assessments | | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
--------------------------------------------- | | Screening | Up to 28 days prior to Day 1 | ICF, Eligibility,
Labs, Imaging, EORTC QLQ-C30 | | Baseline / C1D1 | Day 1 | Randomization, Physical Exam,
First Dose | | Treatment Visits | Every 3 weeks (for 12 months) | Drug Dispensing, AE/SAE
Check, Vitals, Labs | | Imaging | Every 9 weeks | Tumor assessment (per RECIST 1.1) | | End of
Treatment | Within 30 days of last dose | Final Safety Labs, EOT assessments | | Follow-up |
Every 3 months (post-treatment) | Survival Status, Subsequent Therapies |
8.2 Critical Protocol Mandates
SAE Reporting (24-Hour Clock):
Action: Report all SAEs to ClinEdge Global Safety within 24 hours of site awareness. An initial
report meets the deadline; the PI must sign the final report.
Informed Consent Form (ICF):
Action: Always use the most current, IRB-approved version of the ICF. Before consenting, verify
the version and date in the footer against the approved version in your Investigator Site File
(ISF).
IRB Renewals:
Action: Your CRA will initiate the renewal process 90 days before expiry. Respond promptly to
prevent lapses in approval that will halt all study activity.
Emergency Unblinding:
Action: In a medical emergency requiring knowledge of treatment allocation, you must
immediately call the 24/7 Medical Monitor hotline before taking any unblinding action. This is a
major protocol deviation and requires strict adherence to the defined process.
Document Version Control:
Action: Use only official documents from the TMF repository (Protocol, ICF, Manuals). Do not
use locally saved or printed copies without first verifying they are the current version.

Pillar 1: Communication & Escalation Framework
This framework ensures clear, timely, and appropriate communication across the study team,
removing ambiguity during critical events.
Interactive RACI Matrix: A central, filterable RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted,
Informed) matrix is maintained by the CRO. A site coordinator can filter for "IRB Amendment" to
immediately identify all primary/backup contacts and their specific roles.
Visual Escalation Pathways: For high-risk, time-sensitive events (e.g., SAEs, potential protocol
deviations), visual "if-then" flowcharts are provided to make the correct decision the most
straightforward one.
Pillar 2: Site Operations & Data Integrity
This pillar details the day-to-day site activities that drive quality data collection and efficient
patient progression through the trial.
2.1 Subject Enrollment Workflow
RACI Matrix:
Responsible: Site Coordinator
Accountable: Principal Investigator (PI)
Consulted: Sponsor/CRO Medical Monitor (for eligibility questions)
Informed: Data Manager, Sponsor/CRO Project Manager
Workflow Steps & Decision Points:
Identification & Pre-Screening: Coordinator identifies a potential subject and performs initial
screening against protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria.
PI Review (Decision Point): Coordinator presents screening data to the PI. The PI must
medically confirm the subject is a suitable candidate before proceeding.
Informed Consent: Coordinator conducts the consent visit using the latest IRB-approved ICF
version. The subject must be given adequate time to review the document and ask questions.
ICF Execution: The subject, coordinator, and PI sign and date the ICF. A copy is provided to the
subject.
Data Entry (Handoff): Coordinator enters all screening and eligibility data into the Medidata
Rave EDC system.
Randomization: Once eligibility is confirmed in the EDC, the Coordinator accesses the
randomization system to receive the treatment assignment.
Notification (Handoff): The Coordinator notifies the PI, site pharmacy, and Sponsor/CRO
(ClinEdge) of the successful enrollment and updates the site's enrollment log.
Best Practices & Risk Mitigation:
Prevent Delays: Proactively track the status of required source documents (e.g., labs, imaging)
to ensure timely eligibility confirmation.
Version Control: Before every consent, physically check the ICF version number against the
latest IRB approval letter.
PI Availability: Schedule routine "batch reviews" with the PI for eligibility confirmation and ICF
signatures to avoid bottlenecks.
Data Quality: Timely data entry and query resolution are critical to prevent delays in
randomization.
2.2 Data Query Resolution Workflow
RACI Matrix:
Responsible: Site Coordinator
Accountable: PI (for clinical judgments)
Consulted: PI, Monitor
Informed: Data Manager
Workflow Steps & Decision Points:
Generation: A query is generated in Medidata Rave by the Data Manager or an automated
check, triggering an automatic notification to the Coordinator.
Investigation: Coordinator reviews the query and cross-references source documents to find the
correct information.
PI Escalation (Decision Point): If the query requires a clinical judgment (e.g., assessing
causality), the Coordinator MUST escalate it to the PI. Coordinators do not make clinical
judgments.
Resolution: Coordinator enters the corrected data or a clarifying comment in Medidata Rave.
Closure (Handoff): The Data Manager reviews the response and closes the query or re-issues it
if further clarification is needed.
Best Practices & Risk Mitigation:
Set a Target: Aim to resolve all queries within 30 days of generation.
Source-Verify: Always refer to the source document when resolving a query; never answer from
memory.
Address Promptly: Address queries in near real-time as they appear to prevent accumulation.
Pillar 3: Proactive Risk & Compliance Management
These workflows mitigate common and critical compliance risks through structured processes
and clear timelines.
3.1 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting Workflow
RACI Matrix:
Responsible: Site Coordinator
Accountable: PI
Consulted: Sponsor/CRO Medical Monitor
Informed: Sponsor/CRO Pharmacovigilance, Local IRB
The 24-Hour SAE Reporting Clock:
T=0h (Site Awareness): An AE is identified. The PI assesses it for seriousness, severity, and
causality. If it meets SAE criteria, the 24-hour reporting clock starts.
T=0-8h (Documentation): Coordinator completes the SAE Report Form and enters data into the
safety database/EDC.
T=8-20h (PI Review & Signature - Handoff): PI reviews, edits if necessary, and signs the report.
If the PI is unavailable, the Coordinator escalates to the pre-delegated Sub-Investigator.
T=20-24h (Submission): Coordinator submits the PI-signed report to the Sponsor/CRO
(BioNova/ClinEdge).
T=22h (Escalation Trigger): If the PI signature is still missing, an automated alert is sent to the
PI, Site Manager, and CRO Project Manager.
Follow-Up: The Coordinator is responsible for collecting any requested follow-up information
and submitting updated SAE forms until the event is resolved.
Best Practices & Risk Mitigation:
DEADLINE IS NON-NEGOTIABLE: The 24-hour reporting deadline from site awareness is an
absolute regulatory requirement.
SIGNATURE IS REQUIRED: A report submitted without a PI or delegated Sub-I signature is
incomplete and a common audit finding.
BE THOROUGH: A complete and accurate initial report reduces follow-up queries from the
safety team.
3.2 IRB Amendment Submission Workflow
The "Push & Confirm" Model for Version Control:
Push: The Sponsor distributes the amendment package (Protocol, ICF, etc.) to the site PI and
Coordinator via a trackable system. The distribution includes a "Summary of Changes"
document.
Acknowledge: The PI and Coordinator provide an electronic signature confirming receipt and
understanding of the changes.
PI Review (Decision Point): The PI must review and approve the amendment before any IRB
submission.
IRB Submission: The Coordinator prepares and submits the complete package to the local IRB.
Approval & Implementation (Handoff): Upon receiving IRB approval, the Coordinator must:
File the approval letter and stamped documents in the regulatory binder.
Confirm & Archive: Confirm that all previous physical versions of the ICF have been destroyed
or marked "Superseded." This action closes the loop and creates an auditable record.
Document that the entire site team has been trained on the changes.
Best Practices & Risk Mitigation:
CRITICAL: NEVER use an outdated ICF to consent a new subject after an amendment has
been approved. This is a serious compliance breach.
Document Training: Failure to document team training on a new amendment is a common and
preventable audit finding.
3.3 Monitoring Visit Workflow
Workflow Steps:
Scheduling: The Monitor contacts the Coordinator to schedule the visit and confirm objectives.
Preparation: The Coordinator uses the checklist below to prepare all necessary materials and
access.
On-Site Activities: The Monitor conducts Regulatory Binder Review, Source Document
Verification (SDV), and ICF review.
Debrief (Handoff): The Monitor meets with the Coordinator and PI to discuss findings and action
items. PI attendance at the debrief is critical for site oversight.
Follow-Up: The Monitor sends a follow-up letter. The Coordinator leads the resolution of action
items and documents their completion.
Preparation Checklist:
[ ] All regulatory documents are filed and the binder index is up-to-date.
[ ] A quiet space is reserved for the monitor with required EDC and EMR access.
[ ] PI availability for the debrief meeting is confirmed.
[ ] All pending data entry is complete and open queries are addressed before the visit.
[ ] Action items from the previous monitoring letter are resolved and documented.
Pillar 4: Data Governance & Unblinding Controls
This pillar establishes a firewall to protect trial integrity, particularly during interim analyses.
4.1 Unblinding Firewall for Interim Analysis
Workflow Steps & Decision Points:
Formal Request: BioNova formally requests an interim analysis from the independent Data
Monitoring Committee (DMC).
Data Extraction (Handoff): An independent, unblinded statistician, firewalled from the core study
team, extracts the specified data cut from Medidata Rave.
Secure Transfer: The unblinded data is transferred via a secure, audited channel directly to the
DMC. The core Sponsor/CRO team receives only a confirmation of transfer.
DMC Review (Decision Point): The DMC conducts its review in a closed session.
Blinded Recommendation (Handoff): The DMC provides its recommendation (e.g., "Continue
trial as planned") to BioNova. This recommendation contains no unblinded patient or summary
data.
Audit Trail: Every step of this process—from request to recommendation—is logged, signed,
and dated to create a robust audit trail for regulatory inspection.

3. Phase 2: Enrollment (March 2025 – March 2026)
This phase is managed by tracking enrollment velocity against projections, with pre-defined
action triggers to ensure the target of 500 patients in 12 months is met.
3.1 Enrollment Velocity Monitoring & Triggers
Reporting: The CRO will issue a weekly report visualizing Projected vs. Actual enrollment,
including screening, randomization, and screen failure rates by site.
Action Plan: Any site with zero screenings for two consecutive weeks will trigger a mandatory
action plan discussion between the site and the assigned CRA.
| Trigger Event | Target Date | Action Required | | :--- | :--- | :--- | | Trigger 1: Early Velocity Check
| June 2025 (Month 3) | If overall enrollment is <80% of target, activate the first 3 backup sites. |
| Trigger 2: Mid-Point Rescue Plan | Nov 2025 (Month 6) | If enrollment is still <80% of target,
activate remaining backup sites and deploy patient recruitment vendor. A protocol amendment
to adjust I/E criteria will be formally considered. |
3.2 Key Enrollment Milestones

subjects off drug | Completed drug reconciliation logs for all sites. |
6. Overarching Operational Streams (Continuous)
These critical workstreams run in parallel for the duration of the trial.
6.1 Drug Supply Chain Management
Milestones: Manufacturing Slot Secured → IMP Packaged & Labeled → Depot Shipment →
On-Site Inventory Thresholds Met.
Triggers: The IXRS will automatically trigger re-supply shipments when a site's inventory falls
below a pre-defined threshold (e.g., 3-month supply), adjusted based on that site's real-time
enrollment rate.
6.2 TMF & Inspection Readiness
Strategy: The Trial Master File (TMF) will be managed via a "rolling review" model to ensure it is
always current.
Milestones:
Quarterly TMF Quality Checks: CRO and Sponsor conduct joint reviews of the eTMF to ensure
contemporaneous filing and identify gaps early.
Final TMF Reconciliation: An intensive reconciliation period will begin immediately after the last
site closeout visit.
Target: TMF is archived and declared inspection-ready by October 31, 2026.
7. Critical Path & Timeline Management
The primary critical path consists of sequential milestones that directly determine the final
submission date:
First Site Activation → FPI → LPI → LPLV → DBL → Final CSR
This timeline will be actively managed by tracking three dates for each critical path milestone:
Target Date: The planned date outlined in this document.
Projected Date: The current forecast based on real-time progress, updated monthly.
Critical Path Limit: The absolute latest date a milestone can be reached before causing an
unrecoverable delay to the final CSR date, forcing proactive use of contingency plans.

2. The Four Pillars of Quality Management
Our metrics are structured around four pillars, moving from foundational process health to
predictive risk indicators. This framework ensures we are not just reacting to past events but
actively managing the factors that predict trial success.
Pillar 1: Foundational & Process Integrity Metrics
Objective: To measure core operational efficiency, identify systemic friction, and ensure the
fundamental processes of the trial are robust and timely.
| Metric Category | Metric & Definition | Target | Rationale & Impact | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | | Site
Activation & Enrollment | Cycle Time to First Patient In (FPI): Time from "Site Identified" to "FPI,"
tracked by region. | US: <60d<br>EU: <90d<br>APAC: <80d | Highlights regional bottlenecks in
startup (e.g., CTIS vs. local IRB) to enable proactive resource allocation. | | | Enrollment Rate:
Number of subjects enrolled per site, per month. | 1.7 subjects/site/month | Ensures trial is on
track for the 500-patient target by March 2026. Tracked against key milestones. | | |
Screening-to-Enrollment Ratio: Total subjects screened / Total subjects randomized. | < 3:1 | A
high ratio is a leading indicator of restrictive eligibility criteria or recruitment challenges at
specific sites. | | | Enrollment Forecast Accuracy: (Actual / Projected Enrollment) * 100%. | >
90% | Critical for managing sponsor expectations, budget, and resource planning. | | Subject
Engagement | Subject Retention Rate: % of subjects who complete the 18-month trial duration. |
> 85% | Protects the statistical power required for key secondary endpoints like Overall Survival
(OS). | | | Visit Compliance: % of scheduled visits completed within the protocol-defined window.
| > 95% | Poor compliance is a direct threat to data completeness for all endpoints. | | Data Flow
Velocity| CRF Completion Timeliness: % of CRFs entered into Medidata Rave within 5 business
days of the subject visit. | > 90% | Key leading indicator of site engagement; predicts data
backlogs that could delay database lock. | | | Query Resolution Time: Average days from query
issuance to resolution. | < 7 days | Measures data cleaning efficiency. Slow resolution is a major
risk for interim analyses and DMC reviews. | | | Query Aging: % of open queries older than 30
days. | < 10% | Aged queries represent unresolved data issues and are a direct risk to database
lock timelines. |
Pillar 2: Critical Risk & Compliance Indicators
Objective: To create an early warning system by monitoring metrics directly tied to the trial's
most critical compliance, safety, and integrity risks.
| Metric Category | Metric & Definition | Target | Rationale & Impact | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | | Safety
Reporting | SAE Reporting Funnel: A multi-stage time tracker:<br>- T1: Site awareness to initial
report submission.<br>- T2: Submission to medical review.<br>- T3: Review to final PI
signature. | T1: 100% in <24h<br>T2: <48h<br>T3: <5d | Pinpoints the exact point of failure in
the safety reporting chain, moving beyond a simple timeliness metric. | | Regulatory Health |
Regulatory Dossier Health: Days until expiration for key documents (IRB/EC approvals,
licenses, lab certs). | Flag at <60 days | Mitigates the critical risk of lapsed approvals by creating
a proactive task list instead of a reactive crisis. | | | ICF Version Compliance: % of subjects
consented using the most current, IRB-approved ICF version. | 100% | Non-negotiable. A single
error can invalidate a subject's data. Verified by CRAs at every monitoring visit. | | Blinding & IP
Integrity| Unblinding Risk Index: A composite score based on IP accountability errors,
emergency unblinding requests, and inappropriate EDC access roles. | Maintain below alert
threshold | Proactively monitors for subtle procedural weaknesses that could compromise the
blind, rather than waiting for a major breach. | | | Drug Accountability Accuracy: % of
investigational product dispensed, returned, and documented with 100% accuracy. | 100% |
Ensures integrity of the blind and compliance with GMP/GCP standards. | | Protocol Adherence
| Major Protocol Deviation Rate: Number of major protocol deviations / Number of subjects
enrolled. | Track trends | Focuses on deviations that impact subject safety or data integrity. A
spike at a site is an immediate red flag requiring investigation. |
Pillar 3: Endpoint Integrity & Scientific Validity Metrics
Objective: To ensure the data supporting the primary and secondary endpoints is robust,
reliable, and of the highest possible quality.
| Metric Category | Metric & Definition | Target | Rationale & Impact | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | |
Primary Endpoint (PFS) | PFS Data Availability: % of expected tumor assessments (scans)
completed and source-verified within the protocol window. | > 95% | PFS is a time-to-event
endpoint. Missing or late scans can systematically bias the primary results. This is a direct
measure of endpoint quality. | | Secondary Endpoint (QoL) | Missing Data Rate (EORTC
QLQ-C30): % of required fields left blank in the QoL questionnaire at time of data review. | < 2%
| Ensures the dataset for this key secondary endpoint is complete, analyzable, and statistically
sound. | | | Longitudinal Consistency Score (EORTC QLQ-C30): An algorithmic check that flags
illogical patient-reported data trends over time. | Flag sites in bottom 10% | Moves beyond
completion to assess data quality. Identifies sites where subjects may require retraining on the
questionnaire. | | Safety Endpoint | AE/SAE Concordance Rate: % of Grade 3+ AEs in the EDC
that are fully concordant with source documents (dates, severity, causality). | > 98% | Ensures
the drug's safety profile is reported accurately, preventing misinterpretation of its tolerability. | |
Data Veracity | SDV Error Rate: (Data points with discrepancies / Total data points verified) *
100%. | < 5% | A fundamental measure of the accuracy of data transcription from source
documents into the Medidata Rave EDC. |
Pillar 4: Predictive & Cross-Functional Performance Metrics
Objective: To synthesize data from other pillars to forecast performance, identify high- and
low-performing sites, and guide strategic resource allocation.
| Metric Category | Metric & Definition | Target | Rationale & Impact | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | |
Holistic Site Health | Site Performance Index (SPI): A weighted composite score for each site,
combining:<br>1. Enrollment Rate vs. Target<br>2. Data Flow Velocity (CRF & Query
Timeliness)<br>3. Major Protocol Deviation Rate<br>4. SAE Reporting Timeliness (T1) |
Categorize sites: Green, Yellow, Red | Provides a single score to compare all 25 sites. Prevents
a "good enroller" from masking poor data quality and directs monitoring resources where they
are needed most. | | Issue Resolution | CAPA Closure Rate: % of Corrective and Preventive
Actions (CAPAs) closed within the agreed-upon timeline. | > 90% | Measures the organization's
ability to effectively identify, resolve, and learn from systemic issues in a timely manner. | |
Inspection Readiness | Audit Readiness Score: A quarterly self-assessment (1-100) based on a
checklist covering TMF completeness, site binder organization, and compliance metrics. |
Maintain > 95 | Turns the abstract concept of "audit readiness" into a quantifiable metric that can
be tracked and improved over time. |
5. Governance & Action Framework
| Metric | Green Zone (On Target) | Yellow Zone (Monitor) | Red Zone (Action Required) | Data
Source | Frequency | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | | SAE Reporting (T1) | 100% in <24h |
95-99% | < 95% | Safety Database | Weekly | | Enrollment Rate | ≥ 1.7 subjects/site/month | 1.0
- 1.6 | < 1.0 | CTMS / Rave | Weekly | | Query Aging | < 10% of queries >30d old | 10-15% | >
15% | Medidata Rave | Weekly | | Visit Compliance | > 95% | 90-95% | < 90% | Medidata Rave |
Monthly | | ICF Version Compliance| 100% | N/A | < 100% | Monitoring Reports | Per Visit | | Site
Performance Index| Score > 85 (Green) | Score 70-84 (Yellow) | Score < 70 (Red) | Analytics
Dashboard | Monthly |
Proactive Management Strategy:
Identify Trends Early: We will use run charts and control charts to visualize metrics over time. A
negative trend, such as a gradual decline in the Site Performance Index (SPI) for a region, will
trigger a strategic review before individual metrics fall into the red zone.
Trigger Corrective Actions: Any metric entering the Red Zone automatically triggers a root cause
analysis and the creation of a formal CAPA. For example, if PFS Data Availability drops below
95%, we will immediately investigate scan scheduling and data entry workflows at the
contributing sites.
Communicate with Stakeholders: The Trial Health Dashboard will be the central communication
tool for all internal and external stakeholder meetings. This provides a simple, data-driven
summary of trial performance, highlights successes, and transparently addresses operational
challenges and the actions being taken to resolve them.
Agent Persona 2 - Regulatory Advisor
Protocol Requirements
Refresh
Of course. The provided document is already excellent—comprehensive, well-structured, and
demonstrates a strong command of clinical trial management principles. My review focuses on
polishing the language for conciseness, enhancing scannability, and further sharpening the
compliance-focused tone to create an executive-ready final version.
Here is the polished Protocol Requirements document.
Protocol Requirements and Operational Framework: LUMA-201-NSCLC-P3
Document Purpose: This document defines the mandatory requirements for the
LUMA-201-NSCLC-P3 protocol and its operational framework. It serves as the single source of
truth for trial design, embedding scientific, regulatory, and operational best practices into the
trial's foundation. The framework ensures a resilient, inspectable, and globally harmonized
blueprint for execution.
1. Governing Regulatory & Quality Framework
The trial will be conducted in strict compliance with all applicable global and local regulations,
with the protocol serving as the foundational document of the trial's Quality Management
System (QMS). Where regulations differ, the most stringent requirements will be followed.
Global Standard: ICH-GCP E6(R2) is the foundational standard for all trial conduct.
U.S. FDA Regulations (IND #15487):
21 CFR Part 11: Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures
21 CFR Part 50: Protection of Human Subjects (Informed Consent)
21 CFR Part 56: Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)
21 CFR Part 312: Investigational New Drug (IND) Application
EMA Regulations (European Union):
Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014: Managed via the Clinical Trials Information System
(CTIS).
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Governing the personal data of EU subjects.
Local Regulations: Full compliance with the national and local laws, regulations, and ethical
guidelines of each participating country (including the Asia-Pacific region) and any specific
state/national laws within the U.S. or EU.
2. Core Protocol Content Requirements
The protocol must be the unambiguous "single source of truth" and contain the following
specific, actionable details.
Endpoints and Data Integrity:
Primary Endpoint (PFS): Mandate a Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) for
Progression-Free Survival to ensure unbiased assessment. The protocol must reference a
detailed BICR Charter.
Secondary Endpoints: Precisely define data collection schedules and methods for Overall
Survival (OS), Objective Response Rate (ORR), and Quality of Life (QoL).
Safety: Require all Grade 3+ Adverse Events (AEs) to be graded using CTCAE v5.0 criteria.
Eligibility Criteria:
Clarity: Inclusion/Exclusion criteria must be objective and unambiguous to minimize site
interpretation errors.
Verification: Mandate the use of a version-controlled Eligibility Checklist. This checklist must be
completed, signed, and dated by a qualified, delegated investigator for every patient prior to
randomization.
Randomization and Blinding:
Methodology: Detail the double-blind nature of the study and the randomization scheme.
Firewall: Reference a separate Data Access and Blinding Plan that maps user roles to system
permissions and defines the firewalled data flow to the independent Data Monitoring Committee
(DMC).
Unblinding: Include a detailed procedure for emergency unblinding for patient safety, specifying
the request, approval, and documentation process.
Protocol Deviation Management:
Standardization: Prospectively define and categorize protocol deviations (e.g., Minor, Major,
Critical) to ensure consistent reporting across all 25 sites.
Reporting: Explicitly list deviations (e.g., enrolling an ineligible patient, incorrect study drug
administration) that require immediate notification to the sponsor (BioNova) and potential
reporting to the IRB/EC.
3. Operationalizing Global Complexity
The protocol and its associated plans must provide a clear framework for managing regional
variability and ensuring data consistency.
Standard of Care (SoC) Definition:
Approved Regimens: Include an appendix that pre-specifies the approved SoC chemotherapy
regimens for the control arm (e.g., Cisplatin/Pemetrexed).
Exception Process: Outline a formal process for investigators to request the use of a
region-specific SoC not on the list. This process must require written Sponsor/Medical Monitor
approval before a patient is enrolled on that regimen.
Global Informed Consent Form (ICF) Framework:
Version Control: Reference a Global ICF Management Plan to mitigate the high risk of
versioning errors.
Governance: This plan will govern the creation of a "Master" ICF template and the controlled
process for developing and tracking country- and site-specific versions, ensuring a clear
versioning nomenclature (e.g., Protocol Amd 3.0 → Master ICF v4.0 → US-English ICF v4.1).
Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs):
Validation: Specify that the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire must be linguistically validated for
every required language.
Administration: Define the precise methodology for administration (e.g., via a validated
electronic tablet in-clinic, before the patient consults with the physician) to ensure data
consistency and minimize bias.
4. Required Protocol-Associated Documents
The protocol will serve as the central hub, referencing a suite of detailed, version-controlled
operational documents essential for trial conduct and inspection-readiness.
Strategic Charters & Plans:
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) Charter: Defines membership, voting rules, meeting
schedules, statistical stopping rules, and communication pathways.
Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) Charter: Details imaging requirements (RECIST
1.1), adjudication processes, and query resolution.
Global ICF Management Plan: Governs the lifecycle of all ICF versions.
Data Access and Blinding Plan: Defines user permissions and data firewalls.
Safety Data Reconciliation Plan: Defines the process for reconciling the clinical (EDC) and
safety databases to ensure SAE alignment.
Risk-Based Monitoring Plan: Outlines the monitoring strategy, defining which data requires
100% Source Data Verification (SDV) (e.g., ICF, eligibility, primary endpoint) and the approach
for centralized monitoring of other data.
Essential Trial Master File (TMF) Documents:
Final, signed Protocol and all Amendments
IRB/EC-approved Informed Consent Forms (current version)
Current Investigator’s Brochure (IB)
Regulatory authority approvals (e.g., FDA, EMA)
IRB/EC approval letters and correspondence
Signed Form FDA 1572 (U.S.) / Equivalent (ex-U.S.)
Investigator CVs, medical licenses, and Financial Disclosure Forms
Delegation of Authority Log
Site and Sponsor Staff Training Records
Laboratory Certifications and Normal Ranges
All relevant study manuals (e.g., Laboratory, Pharmacy)

5.2. Protocol Amendment Process
Classify: Sponsor identifies a required change and classifies it as "substantial" (impacting safety,
scope, or endpoints) or "administrative."
Draft: Sponsor drafts the amendment, assigns a new version number, and finalizes the
document.
Submit: Substantial amendments are submitted to all relevant Regulatory Authorities and
IRBs/ECs.
Approve: An amendment cannot be implemented at a site until documented approval from both
the relevant Regulatory Authority and the site’s IRB/EC is obtained.
Implement: Following approval, all relevant staff are trained, and updated documents (e.g., ICF)
are put into use before the changes take effect.
5.3. Critical Safety Reporting Process
Adherence to this process is a critical compliance requirement.
Site Responsibility:
Clock Start: The 24-hour reporting clock begins the moment any member of the site study team
becomes aware of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).
Initial Report: The site must report the SAE to the sponsor (BioNova) within 24 hours of
awareness, even if all details are not yet known.
PI Oversight: The SAE report is not complete until reviewed and signed by the Principal
Investigator. Missing signatures represent a major compliance gap and must be resolved
urgently.
Sponsor Responsibility: BioNova is responsible for all subsequent expedited reporting to
Regulatory Authorities and IRBs/ECs according to applicable timelines (e.g., 7-day and 15-day
reports).
6. Roles & Responsibilities
Clear roles are essential for successful execution. A detailed RACI (Responsible, Accountable,
Consulted, Informed) matrix will be maintained as a separate project management document.
Sponsor (BioNova Therapeutics): Accountable for the entire trial. Holds the IND/CTA, ensures
proper monitoring, and is ultimately responsible for all regulatory reporting and trial conduct.
CRO (ClinEdge Global): Responsible for delegated tasks as defined in the scope of work,
including site monitoring, management, and TMF maintenance, acting on behalf of the sponsor.
Principal Investigator (PI): Accountable for trial conduct at their site. This non-delegable
responsibility includes protecting patient rights and safety, ensuring a compliant informed
consent process, supervising all trial staff, and maintaining accurate records. The PI's signature
is a personal attestation of oversight.
IRB/Ethics Committee (EC): Responsible for providing independent ethical oversight and for
reviewing and approving trial documents to protect the welfare of human subjects.
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC): Responsible for the independent, interim review of
unblinded safety and efficacy data to provide recommendations to the sponsor regarding trial
continuation, modification, or termination.

3.0 Pillar 1: Strategic Framework
This section defines the foundational elements of the document ecosystem.
3.1 Essential Document Inventory
All essential documents, categorized according to the TMF Reference Model, shall be
maintained in the electronic Trial Master File (eTMF).
| Category | Key Documents | | :--- | :--- | | Study-Level | Protocol & Amendments, Investigator’s
Brochure (IB), Master Informed Consent Form (ICF), Monitoring Plan, Data Management Plan
(DMP), Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), Safety Management Plan, Investigational Product
Handling Manual, CRF Completion Guidelines, Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) Charter | |
Site-Level | Site-Specific ICFs, IRB/IEC Approval Letters & Correspondence, Form FDA 1572,
Investigator CVs & Medical Licenses, Financial Disclosure Forms (FDFs), Delegation of
Authority Log, Site Training Records, Lab Certifications & Normal Ranges, Temperature Logs,
Subject Screening/Enrollment Log, Signed ICFs, Completed SAE Reports |
3.2 Document Interdependency Mapping
A change in a core document automatically triggers a required update in dependent documents.
Example Trigger: Protocol Amendment v2.0 requires updates to:
Master ICF v2.0
Investigator’s Brochure v3.0
Pharmacy Manual v2.0
CRF Completion Guidelines v2.0
Triggers a Global Distribution & Training Record for all sites.
3.3 Version Control Standard
Naming Convention: A strict naming convention will be enforced: [Document Type]_[Protocol
#]_[Version #]_[DD-MON-YYYY].
Example: Protocol_LUMA-201-NSCLC-P3_v2.0_15-FEB-2025.pdf
Version Numbering:
Major (e.g., 2.0): Substantive changes requiring IRB/IEC or regulatory approval.
Minor (e.g., 2.1): Administrative changes (e.g., typo correction) not impacting patient safety,
rights, or data integrity.
Change History: All new versions of the Protocol, Master ICF, and IB must include a "Summary
of Changes" section.
Status Control: Upon a new version's effective date, the previous version will be immediately
archived and marked as "Superseded" in the eTMF, with read-only access for audit purposes.
3.4 Global Harmonization and Translation
Country-Specific Requirements: A Global Harmonization Appendix will identify all documents
requiring country-specific templates or content (e.g., ICFs with GDPR language for EU sites).
Translation Management: A certified translation process (including forward/back translation and
reconciliation) will be used for all participant-facing documents. Each translated version will
have its own version-controlled lifecycle.
4.0 Pillar 2: Approval and Signature Governance
This section defines the processes for authorizing and executing trial documents.
4.1 Approval Workflows
All controlled documents will follow a pre-defined, sequential approval workflow within the eTMF
system. The workflow will electronically route documents for review and signature, and upon
final approval, automatically publish the document as "Effective" and notify relevant
stakeholders.
4.2 Responsibility Matrix (RACI)
| Document Type | Author/Drafter | Reviewers | Final Approver(s) | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | | Protocol
& Amendments | BioNova Therapeutics | ClinEdge Global, Coordinating Investigator | BioNova
Head of Clinical Operations | | Master ICF | BioNova Therapeutics | ClinEdge Global,
Legal/Regulatory | BioNova Head of Clinical Operations | | Investigator's Brochure | BioNova

ClinEdge Global | BioNova Clinical Trial Manager | BioNova Head of Clinical Operations | |
Site-Specific ICF | Site Staff / CRO | Site PI | Institutional Review Board (IRB) / Ethics
Committee (IEC) | | SAE Reports | Site Coordinator | Site Principal Investigator (PI) | Sponsor
Safety Team (post-PI signature) |
4.3 Signature Requirements
Electronic signatures must be 21 CFR Part 11 compliant.
| Document | Signature Method | Required Signatory | Compliance Focus | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | |
Protocol Signature Page | Wet Ink or Part 11 e-Signature | Principal Investigator | Documents PI
agreement to conduct the trial per protocol. | | Form FDA 1572 | Wet Ink Signature | Principal
Investigator | Fulfills regulatory requirement for an original signature. | | Informed Consent Form
| Wet Ink Signature | Participant, Person Conducting Consent | Original signed forms are
maintained at the site as source. | | SAE Reports | Part 11 e-Signature | Principal Investigator |
PI signature confirms causality/severity assessment before submission. |
5.0 Pillar 3: Risk-Based Document Controls
Proactive, system-based controls are implemented to mitigate high-risk compliance failures.
5.1 Control: Preventing Use of Outdated ICFs
A Site Activation Packet is required in the eTMF before site activation. This packet must contain
the final, IRB/IEC-approved, site-specific ICF with mandatory metadata fields for "ICF Version"
and "IRB Approval Date." This programmatically prevents site activation with an incorrect ICF.
5.2 Control: Ensuring Timely SAE Reporting
An SAE Smart Form in the EDC system will auto-route to the PI for a Part 11 compliant
e-signature. An internal 20-hour clock will trigger automated reminders to the PI, coordinator,
and CRA if the signature is pending, ensuring the 24-hour regulatory reporting deadline is met.
5.3 Control: Preventing Premature Unblinding
The eTMF is partitioned with strict, role-based access controls. A restricted folder ("DMC
Unblinded Data") is accessible only to authorized DMC members and the independent
statistician. All access events generate a high-visibility audit trail reviewed monthly by Quality
Assurance.
5.4 Control: Managing Document Expiration
The eTMF will track expiration dates for IRB/IEC Approvals, Medical Licenses, and Lab
Certifications. Automated email notifications will be sent to the Project Manager and assigned
CRA at 90, 60, and 30 days prior to expiration to ensure timely renewal.
6.0 Pillar 4: Distribution, Access, and Training
Systems are designed for clarity, usability, and user compliance.
6.1 Distribution and Access Control
Single Source of Truth: The eTMF is the sole repository and distribution source for all current,
effective study documents. Distribution via email is prohibited.
Role-Based Access: Personnel will have read-only access to the latest approved versions of
documents relevant to their specific role.
6.2 Curated, Role-Based Views
The eTMF will provide curated dashboards or "views" for key roles. For example, a Site
Coordinator View will prominently display the current protocol, lab manual, and ICF template,
alongside an "Action Items" list for pending tasks.
6.3 Communication and Training on Updates
Automated Notifications: Approval of a new document version triggers an automated eTMF
notification to all impacted personnel.
Read & Acknowledge: For major updates (e.g., protocol amendment), recipients must
electronically acknowledge review. This acknowledgement is often paired with a mandatory,
short training module (e.g., a 5-minute video overview of changes) that must be completed. All
training and acknowledgement records are filed in the eTMF.
7.0 Pillar 5: Continuous Inspection Readiness
The trial will be managed in a state of constant audit readiness.
7.1 Audit Trail Integrity
All systems (eTMF, EDC) will generate a complete, unalterable audit trail for every document
action, capturing the user, action, timestamp, and reason for change (if applicable). The audit
trail must provide a clear, chronological narrative of the document's lifecycle to demonstrate
GCP compliance.
7.2 Periodic TMF Quality Reviews
Formal TMF completeness and quality reviews are scheduled to coincide with major trial
milestones (e.g., First Patient In, 50% Enrollment, Database Lock). These internal reviews will
generate a formal report with Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPAs) to ensure gaps are
remediated in near-real-time.
7.3 Pre-Configured Reporting
The eTMF will feature pre-configured reports and saved searches to rapidly assemble
document packages for regulatory submissions or queries (e.g., "All U.S. Site IRB Approvals,"
"Annual IND Safety Report Source Documents"), ensuring both speed and accuracy.
Compliance Diagrams
Refresh
Of course. Here is the reviewed and polished version of the Compliance Diagrams document.

3.0 Global Regulatory & Ethics Pathway
This section outlines the critical submission and approval pathways for a multi-regional trial,
emphasizing tracking and maintenance requirements.
Actionable Guidance:
Centralized Tracking: ClinEdge Global will maintain a master regulatory tracking log detailing
the submission and approval status for all 25 sites across all jurisdictions.
Regulatory Interdependencies:
FDA (U.S.): IND #15487 must be maintained in active status. All protocol amendments and
safety reports will be submitted to this IND.
EMA (EU): The central CTIS submission serves all EU countries. However, country-specific
requirements (e.g., ICF language, data privacy notifications) must be met, documented, and
tracked for each of the 6 EU member states.
IRB/EC Approval Management (High-Risk Area):
Proactive Monitoring: The CTMS will generate an automated alert 90 days prior to any IRB/EC
approval expiration.
CRA Responsibility: The assigned CRA is responsible for ensuring the site submits its renewal
application no later than 60 days before expiration.
Compliance Hard Stop: No trial activities (including enrollment, treatment, or follow-up
procedures) may continue at a site with a lapsed IRB/EC approval. This will be verified at every
monitoring visit.
Data Privacy Compliance (GDPR):
All EU sites must adhere to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This requires
specific, approved language in the ICF regarding the use, storage, and transfer of personal
health data.
A fully executed Data Transfer Agreement must be in place between BioNova, ClinEdge Global,
and applicable EU entities to govern the transfer of data to U.S.-based servers.
4.0 Core Compliance Workflows
These workflows map critical data and processes, embedding auditable compliance checks that
align with ICH-GCP principles.
4.1 Informed Consent Lifecycle (ICH-GCP 2.10, 4.8)
This workflow ensures consent is validly obtained, documented, and maintained throughout the
trial. It is a primary focus area for regulatory inspections.
Process Steps:
ICF Version Verification: Prior to approaching a potential participant, site staff must verify they
are using the current, site-specific, IRB/EC-approved version of the ICF by checking the
Investigator Site File (ISF) against the master eTMF.
Informed Discussion: A qualified individual, as listed on the Delegation of Authority Log,
conducts the consent discussion in a private setting, ensuring the participant understands all
study elements and has ample time for questions.
Compliant Documentation:
The participant personally signs and dates the ICF before any study-related procedures are
performed.
The individual who conducted the consent discussion also signs and dates the ICF.
A signed copy of the ICF is provided to the participant.
The original, fully executed ICF is filed in the ISF as a source document.
EDC Entry: The date of consent is entered into Medidata Rave. The system is configured with
edit checks to prevent the entry of procedure dates that precede the consent date.
Re-consent Triggers: Re-consenting participants with a new, IRB/EC-approved ICF is
mandatory following:
Protocol amendments affecting study procedures, risks, or benefits.
Clinically significant updates to the Investigator's Brochure (IB).
New safety findings that could influence a participant's willingness to continue.
Auditor Focus: Inspectors will trace a sample of subjects from the clinical database back to the
original signed ICF. They will meticulously verify that the ICF version was correct for the date of
signing and that this date precedes all other documented study activities.
Common Deficiencies to Avoid:
Outdated ICF Version: A critical finding. A version control log must be maintained at each site.
Missing Signatures/Dates: Incomplete forms invalidate the consent.
Pre-dating or Back-dating: Any evidence of such activity constitutes serious non-compliance.
4.2 Data Integrity & Management (ALCOA-C & 21 CFR Part 11)
This workflow maps the data lifecycle from source generation to database lock, ensuring
adherence to the principles of ALCOA-C (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original,
Accurate, and Complete).
Data Management Workflow:
| Role/System | Action | Compliance Checkpoint | | :--- | :--- | :--- | | Site (PI/Coordinator) | 1.
Source Data Generation: Data recorded in medical records, lab reports, patient diaries, etc. |
Original & Contemporaneous: Data recorded in real-time. | | Site (Coordinator) | 2. eCRF
Transcription: Data transcribed from source into Medidata Rave. | Accurate & Timely: Data entry
occurs within the timeframe specified in the Data Management Plan. | | CRO (Monitor) | 3.
Source Data Verification (SDV): Compares eCRF data against source documents. | Verification:
100% SDV for primary endpoint data; risk-based SDV for other data per Monitoring Plan.
Discrepancies are queried. | | Medidata Rave (System) | 4. Query Generation: Monitor or Data
Manager raises a query in the EDC system. | Audit Trail: System automatically logs the query,
user, and timestamp (21 CFR Part 11). | | Site (Coordinator/PI) | 5. Query Resolution: Site
investigates the query, provides a correction or explanation, and saves the change. The PI
electronically signs off on the data. | Attributable: The audit trail captures the change (who, what,
when, why). | | Sponsor/CRO | 6. Database Lock: After final data cleaning and query resolution,
the database is locked, preventing further changes. | Finalization: A critical, irreversible trial
milestone. |
Auditor Focus: Auditors will perform an "end-to-end" data trace, selecting a key data point from
a final CSR table and requiring proof of its path back to the original source document. They will
scrutinize the 21 CFR Part 11-compliant audit trail in Medidata Rave for any unauthorized or
undocumented changes.
Common Deficiencies to Avoid:
Source-to-eCRF Discrepancies: The most common data integrity finding.
Unresolved/Aging Queries: Indicates poor oversight. An escalation plan must be in place for
queries open >30 days.
Lack of PI Oversight: Failure of the PI to review and electronically sign subject data in the EDC
is a violation of ICH-GCP 4.9.
4.3 Safety & Pharmacovigilance Workflow
This critical-path workflow ensures the timely and accurate reporting of serious adverse events
(SAEs) to protect patient safety and meet global regulatory obligations.
SAE Reporting: The 24-Hour Timeline
Event Detection (Site Level - Clock Starts): A PI or delegated site staff member becomes aware
of an event that meets the criteria for an SAE.
Immediate PI Assessment: The site PI must promptly assess the event for seriousness, severity,
and causality (relationship to the investigational product, Lumarex), and document this
assessment in the source records.
Reporting to Sponsor (within 24 hours of awareness):
Site staff complete the official SAE Report Form.
Compliance Gate: The form must include the PI's causality assessment and signature. An
unsigned form is considered incomplete.
The completed, signed form is submitted to the ClinEdge Global safety team and BioNova via
the designated safety portal within 24 hours.
Sponsor/CRO Processing & Triage:
The ClinEdge safety team logs the event and verifies the SAE form for completeness.
Incomplete forms are immediately returned to the site for correction; the 24-hour clock does not
reset.
BioNova's safety physician determines if the event qualifies as a Suspected Unexpected
Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR).
Expedited Reporting to Authorities:
Fatal or Life-Threatening SUSARs: Reported to FDA and EMA (via EudraVigilance) within 7
calendar days.
All Other SUSARs: Reported within 15 calendar days.
IRB/EC Reporting: The site PI is responsible for reporting the event to their local IRB/EC
according to their specific policies and timelines.
Auditor Focus: An inspector will select multiple SAEs and compare the "date of site awareness"
in source documents to the receipt timestamp of the SAE report by the sponsor. Any gap
exceeding 24 hours is a major finding. They will also verify the consistency of the causality
assessment across the source, eCRF, and the final regulatory submission.
Common Deficiencies to Avoid:
Late Reporting (>24h): The most critical and frequently cited safety-related finding.
Missing PI Causality Assessment/Signature: Invalidates the initial report and causes critical
delays.
Inconsistent Event Reporting: The event narrative, severity, or causality differs between source,
eCRF, and regulatory submissions.
5.0 Quality Management & Oversight
This section defines the framework for ensuring the overall quality and integrity of trial conduct
and data, per ICH-GCP Section 5.
RACI Chart: Key Responsibilities
| Process | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | |
Protocol Amendment Implementation | Site Staff, ClinEdge | BioNova | PIs, Coordinating
Investigator | All Sites, DMC | | SAE Reporting (<24h) | Site PI / Coordinator | Site PI | BioNova

ClinEdge Monitor | BioNova Data Mgmt | | IRB Renewal Submission | Site Coordinator | Site PI |
ClinEdge Monitor | BioNova Regulatory | | Final CSR Approval | BioNova Medical Writer |
BioNova Head of Clinical | Coordinating Investigator, Key PIs | All PIs, ClinEdge |
Key Oversight Activities:
Trial Master File (TMF) Management: The eTMF will be maintained in real-time. ClinEdge will
conduct quarterly QC checks to ensure the TMF is complete, accurate, and inspection-ready at
all times.
Clinical Monitoring: The Monitoring Plan defines the frequency, intensity, and methodology of
site monitoring activities, including the 100% SDV requirement for primary endpoint data.
Monitoring visit reports are reviewed by BioNova to identify site-level trends or systemic issues.
Audits & Inspections: BioNova's Quality Assurance department may conduct audits of sites,
vendors (ClinEdge), or systems. All parties are required to maintain a state of readiness for
regulatory inspections (e.g., FDA, EMA) at all times.
Risk & Controls
Refresh
Of course. This is an excellent, well-structured document that effectively links strategic risks to
operational controls. My review and polishing focused on enhancing clarity, ensuring
consistency, and sharpening the professional tone to make it an even more powerful and
actionable tool for the entire study team.
The core strength of your original document—the integration of the "why" (strategy) with the
"how" (operations)—has been preserved and amplified.
Here is the polished version.
Integrated Risk & Controls Framework: LUMA-201
Trial: LUMA-201 Phase III: A Randomized, Double-Blind Study of Lumarex vs. Standard
Chemotherapy in Advanced NSCLC Protocol: LUMA-201-NSCLC-P3 Sponsor: BioNova
Therapeutics CRO: ClinEdge Global
1. Introduction and Purpose
This document outlines the integrated risk management and quality control framework for the
LUMA-201 trial. Its purpose is to serve as a single, actionable guide that unifies high-level
strategic risk mitigation with granular, operational-level controls.
This framework is designed to proactively protect the scientific integrity of the data, the safety of
trial subjects, and the ultimate viability of the global regulatory submission. It moves beyond
simply preventing individual audit findings to create a state of continuous inspection-readiness.
All activities described herein are designed to ensure compliance with ICH-GCP E6(R2), FDA
regulations (21 CFR Part 11), EMA (CTIS), and GDPR requirements.
2. Strategic Risk Framework
Our risk management philosophy is built on three pillars that address fundamental threats to the
trial's primary objectives. All operational risks and controls detailed in this document are mapped
to one of these strategic pillars.
Pillar 1: Programmatic & Scientific Integrity: Mitigating risks that could undermine the scientific
validity of the trial's results and their acceptance by regulatory authorities. This includes threats
from data interpretation, endpoint variability, and divergent global regulatory expectations.
Pillar 2: Operational Resilience & Human Factors: Ensuring global operations are robust against
systemic pressures and human error. This addresses the reliability of complex processes, such
as pharmacovigilance and the management of protocol amendments across numerous sites.
Pillar 3: Data & Systems Fortification: Ensuring the end-to-end integrity of the trial's "digital trail."
This extends beyond system validation to encompass the entire data lifecycle—from source
data generation (e.g., ePRO, Central Labs) to its final inclusion in the Clinical Study Report,
while rigorously protecting the study blind.
3. Integrated Risk Register and Mitigation Plan
This section details specific operational risks, maps them to their strategic impact, and outlines
the corresponding prevention, detection, and remediation controls.
Pillar 1: Programmatic & Scientific Integrity
| Strategic Risk | Specific Operational Risk(s) | Potential Impact on LUMA-201 | Prevention
Controls | Detection & Monitoring (KPIs) | Remediation & Escalation | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
:--- | | Endpoint Adjudication & Interpretation Variability | • Source documentation gaps<br>•
Undocumented protocol deviations | Critical Risk. Investigator-to-investigator variability in
interpreting tumor progression introduces bias, threatening the reliability of the primary PFS
endpoint. Incomplete source data makes central review impossible and is a primary cause of
major regulatory inspection findings. | Charters & Manuals:<br>☐ Establish a Blinded
Independent Central Review (BICR) Charter.<br>☐ Establish an Endpoint Adjudication
Committee (EAC) Charter.<br>☐ Develop a standardized Imaging Manual for all
sites.<br>Training & Tools:<br>☐ Conduct mandatory ALCOA+ training at SIV.<br>☐ Provide
detailed CRF Completion Guidelines.<br>☐ Use a standardized Protocol Deviation Log
template. | Monitoring:<br>• 100% SDV for primary endpoint (PFS) data.<br>• Query aging rate
(>30 days).<br>• % of queries related to missing source.<br>Oversight:<br>• Discrepancy rate
between site PI and BICR reads.<br>• DMC review of efficacy data trends. | 1. Query: Data
Management issues queries for missing or inconsistent source data.<br>2. Retraining: A trend
of source data queries at a site triggers targeted CRA retraining.<br>3. Adjudication: Discordant
PFS reads are resolved per the process in the BICR Charter.<br>4. Escalation: Systemic data
quality issues are escalated to the DMC and Sponsor leadership. | | Misalignment of Global
Regulatory Expectations | N/A (Strategic Level) | Critical Risk. A successful US submission may
face major hurdles in the EU if subtle differences in FDA vs. EMA expectations (e.g., handling of
intercurrent events) are not prospectively addressed, jeopardizing global market access. |
Strategy & Planning:<br>☐ Maintain an Integrated Global Regulatory Strategy Document
mapping key FDA vs. EMA requirements.<br>☐ The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will
pre-specify analyses tailored to each agency's preferences.<br>☐ Maintain a consolidated log
of all health authority advice and document its disposition. | Governance:<br>• Periodic review
of the regulatory strategy by a cross-functional team.<br>• Mock FDA/EMA advisory committee
meetings to pressure-test the data package. | 1. Assessment: New guidance from FDA/EMA
triggers an immediate impact assessment on the protocol and SAP.<br>2. Amendment: If
required, amend study documents to align with agency expectations.<br>3. Interaction:
Proactively seek agency feedback via formal meetings if significant divergence is anticipated. |
Pillar 2: Operational Resilience & Human Factors
| Strategic Risk | Specific Operational Risk(s) | Potential Impact on LUMA-201 | Prevention
Controls | Detection & Monitoring (KPIs) | Remediation & Escalation | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
:--- | | Pharmacovigilance (PV) System Failure | • Late SAE report (>24h)<br>• Missing PI
signature on SAE form | Critical Risk. Systemic failures (e.g., inconsistent causality
assessments, reconciliation errors between clinical and safety databases) can compromise
subject safety, lead to clinical holds, and corrupt the safety data in the final submission. |
Systems & Processes:<br>☐ Implement a formal monthly reconciliation process between the
EDC and safety database.<br>☐ Conduct a documented SUSAR "fire drill" to test the
end-to-end reporting chain.<br>☐ Configure safety database for automated alerts.<br>Site
Tools & Training:<br>☐ Provide a 1-page AE/SAE Assessment Guide to standardize
investigator assessments.<br>☐ Provide laminated "SAE Reporting Workflow" cards to sites. |
KPIs:<br>• Average time from SAE awareness to report submission (Goal: <24h).<br>• % of
discrepancies found during monthly DB reconciliation.<br>• % of SAE reports queried for
missing PI signature.<br>Trigger: Average SAE reporting time >36h at a site triggers immediate
retraining and a CAPA. | 1. Immediate Action: Submit late SAE report immediately. Issue query
for missing signature.<br>2. Documentation: Document reason for delay in source and safety
database. File a Protocol Deviation.<br>3. RCA/CAPA: Perform a root cause analysis (e.g.,
knowledge gap, process failure) and implement a CAPA (e.g., retrain staff, assign backup
reporter).<br>4. Escalation: Recurrent delays are reported to the IRB and may require
notification to Health Authorities. | | "Consent Drift" & Amendment Fatigue | • Use of outdated
Informed Consent Forms (ICFs) | Critical Risk. Invalidates consent and renders associated data
unusable. "Amendment fatigue" can lead to poor re-consenting conversations, where subjects
do not fully understand new risks—a major ethical and regulatory violation. | Document
Control:<br>☐ Use a centralized eTMF with strict version control; mark all old versions
"Superseded."<br>☐ Use automated eTMF notifications to sites upon approval of a new
ICF.<br>Process Controls:<br>☐ Create a formal Amendment Implementation Plan for each
protocol amendment.<br>☐ Conduct amendment-specific training for sites focusing on "What's
New." | Monitoring:<br>• % of ICFs with errors (e.g., incorrect version, missing signatures).<br>•
eTMF QC review for re-consent documentation post-amendment.<br>Trigger: Any site
exceeding a 5% error rate on ICFs triggers a retraining visit and CAPA. | 1. Immediate Action:
Quarantine data collected under the incorrect ICF. Re-consent the subject immediately using the
valid version.<br>2. Documentation: File a Protocol Deviation. Write a detailed note-to-file
explaining the event and corrective action.<br>3. Assessment: In consultation with the Sponsor
and IRB, determine if quarantined data can be used.<br>4. Notification: Report the deviation to
the local IRB. Systemic issues constitute serious non-compliance and must be reported to the
FDA/EMA. |
Pillar 3: Data & Systems Fortification
| Strategic Risk | Specific Operational Risk(s) | Potential Impact on LUMA-201 | Prevention
Controls | Detection & Monitoring (KPIs) | Remediation & Escalation | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
:--- | | Integrity of the Digital Trail | • Expired lab certifications<br>• Inaccurate Delegation of
Authority (DoA) Log | High Risk. Data integrity is compromised if any link in the digital chain is
broken or unvalidated. Expired lab certifications may invalidate biomarker/safety data. An
improper DoA log undermines the credibility of all data collected by un-delegated staff. |
Systems & Vendor Oversight:<br>☐ Create a master Data Flow Diagram & Vendor Integration
Plan mapping the data lifecycle.<br>☐ Maintain a central tracker for all site lab certifications
with automated expiry reminders.<br>Process Controls:<br>☐ DoA log must be completed at
SIV and updated prospectively.<br>☐ CRA to review DoA log against training records at every
monitoring visit. | Review & QC:<br>• A Comprehensive Digital Audit Trail Review Plan
mandates periodic, risk-based review of audit trails from all key systems (EDC, ePRO,
etc.).<br>• eTMF QC for up-to-date lab certifications and DoA logs.<br>• eTMF completeness
metric (Goal >95%). | 1. Correction: Issue queries for data discrepancies. Request updated
documentation from sites.<br>2. Data Assessment: If lab certifications were expired, assess the
validity of data generated during that period.<br>3. CAPA: Implement a CAPA for sites with
persistent documentation issues.<br>4. Escalation: Significant questions about data integrity
are escalated to the Sponsor and may require vendor re-validation or site audits. | | Unblinding
& Information Contamination | • Inappropriate access to unblinded data or reports | Critical Risk.
Any breach of the study blind—however subtle—threatens the scientific validity of this
double-blind trial and can render the results uninterpretable by regulators. | Planning & Access
Control:<br>☐ Develop a standalone Blinding Integrity & Management Plan detailing all
measures to protect the blind.<br>☐ The DMC Charter must create a "communication firewall"
between the unblinded DMC statistician and the core project teams.<br>☐ Implement strict,
documented role-based access controls in all relevant systems. | Audit & Review:<br>• Periodic
system audit trail review for unauthorized access patterns.<br>• Review of monitoring reports
and site communications for potentially unblinding information.<br>• DMC review of data for any
patterns suggesting unblinding. | 1. Immediate Action: Revoke access for any user with
inappropriate permissions.<br>2. Impact Assessment: Conduct a formal investigation to
determine the scope of the breach and the potential impact on study integrity.<br>3.
Documentation: Thoroughly document the breach, investigation, and outcome.<br>4.
Notification: Report any confirmed, significant breach to the IRB, Sponsor, and relevant Health
Authorities (FDA/EMA). |
4. General Risk Management Workflow
All identified operational risks will be managed according to the following standardized process
flow. This ensures consistency in risk handling from identification through to resolution and
prevention of recurrence.

3.0 The Strategic Readiness Framework: The Story of LUMA-201
Our preparation is organized around four core "chapters." Each chapter represents a critical part
of the trial's story, supported by specific evidence (documents) that substantiate our
commitment to quality and compliance.
3.1 Chapter 1: Governance and Proactive Oversight
The Narrative: "We established a robust framework of control from day one, with clear
delegation of duties and active, data-driven oversight of all key partners."
Key Evidence & Strategic Documents:
Integrated Oversight Plan: A master document defining the relationships, communication
pathways, and escalation procedures between BioNova, ClinEdge Global, Medidata, and the
DMC.
Key Performance Indicator (KPI) & Quality Tolerance Limit (QTL) Tracker: A living document
tracking pre-defined QTLs (e.g., <5% major protocol deviations), with documented records of
any breaches and corresponding CAPAs, demonstrating proactive quality management per ICH
E6(R2).
Key Decision Log: A log detailing the rationale behind critical decisions (e.g., protocol
amendments), providing context beyond formal documentation.
Foundational TMF Documents: Evidence is primarily located in Sections 01 (Protocol), 03 (Site
Docs), 06 (Monitoring), and 07 (Data Management) of the eTMF.
3.2 Chapter 2: The Human Element: Competence and Communication
The Narrative: "Every individual involved in this trial was qualified, appropriately trained on the
most current procedures, and understood their specific responsibilities."
Key Evidence & Strategic Documents:
Role-Based Training Matrix: Defines required training for each role (PI, CRC, Monitor) and
includes curricula for high-risk or complex procedures.
Investigator Meeting Minutes & Follow-up Actions: Documents key compliance messages and
site attestations of understanding.
Communications Plan: A formal plan with evidence of execution (e.g., read-receipts) for
communicating amendments, ICF changes, and safety updates.
Foundational TMF Documents: Evidence is located in Section 03 (Site Documents), including
CVs, medical licenses, FDA 1572s, Financial Disclosures, and especially the Delegation of
Authority Log and Site Training Records.
3.3 Chapter 3: The Patient's Journey: From Consent to Follow-Up
The Narrative: "We protected the rights, safety, and welfare of every patient at every step, with a
meticulous consent process and immediate, thorough safety reporting."
Key Evidence & Strategic Documents:
Master ICF Version & Translation Control Log: A centralized log linking every ICF version
(including translations) to its IRB/EC approval letter and authorized date range for use.
SAE Reconciliation "Storyboards": For complex SAEs/SUSARs, a one-page chronological
summary of the event from source to regulatory submission, including key timestamps and
system screenshots.
GDPR Compliance Package (for EU Sites): A dedicated package including the Data Protection
Impact Assessment (DPIA), consent for data transfer, and records of Data Protection Officer
(DPO) involvement.
Foundational TMF Documents: Evidence is located in Section 02 (IRB/IEC), 04 (Subject Files),
and 05 (Safety Reporting). The completeness of signed ICFs and SAE reports is paramount.
3.4 Chapter 4: The Data's Journey: From Source to Submission
The Narrative: "The data supporting our primary endpoint is complete, accurate, and
attributable, with a clear and unbroken chain of custody from the clinic to the final database."
Key Evidence & Strategic Documents:
Data Provenance Map: A visual flowchart mapping a critical data point (e.g., tumor
measurement for PFS) from its source document, through eCRF entry, to the final statistical
output.
Interim Analysis Blinding Procedures: A signed document detailing procedures for maintaining
the blind during interim analyses, including access controls and firewalled communication plans.
System Validation & Access Control Reviews: Documentation of EDC User Acceptance Testing
(UAT) and periodic reviews of user access lists to ensure timely removal of unauthorized
personnel.
Foundational TMF Documents: Evidence is located in Section 07 (Data Management), including
the DMP, validation documentation (21 CFR Part 11 compliant), and query logs.
4.0 Foundational Documentation: The eTMF Master Plan
The electronic Trial Master File (eTMF) is the single source of truth that provides the evidence
for our narrative. It is structured according to the TMF Reference Model to ensure documents
are filed contemporaneously and correctly, making audit preparation a process of verification,
not last-minute assembly.

5.0 Continuous Readiness Activities
We will maintain a state of continuous readiness through regular self-inspection and adaptive
management. This is an ongoing process, not a one-time event.
5.1 Proactive Self-Assessment & QC
This self-assessment will be conducted quarterly and immediately upon audit notification.
| Area | Key Question / Item | Gap Analysis & Remediation Plan | | :--- | :--- | :--- | | Subject
Safety & Rights | Does every subject file contain the correct, IRB-approved version of the ICF
signed before any study procedures were performed? | Risk: Inconsistent ICF versioning. <br/>
Action: Perform 100% QC of all ICFs. Establish process requiring eTMF upload within 24 hours
of signing. Monitor to verify 100% at next visit. | | Subject Safety & Rights | Is every SAE report
signed by the PI and reported to stakeholders within the required regulatory timeframes? | Risk:
Missing PI signatures; delayed reporting. <br/> Action: Implement e-signature workflow. Utilize a
central safety portal with automated time-stamping for tracking. | | Investigator Oversight | Does
the Delegation Log accurately reflect all staff performing study tasks, with appropriate start/end
dates and PI signatures? | Risk: Staff performing tasks are not on the log. <br/> Action: Review
logs at every monitoring visit. Retrain sites on maintaining a "living" Delegation of Authority log. |
| Data Integrity | Can a critical data point (e.g., PFS date) be traced from the EDC back to the
certified source document? | Risk: Missing source documentation. <br/> Action: If source is
missing, locate original or create a certified copy. If not possible, document with a note-to-file
explaining the absence. | | Investigational Product | Are temperature logs complete and do they
show any excursions? If so, were excursions documented, investigated, and resolved? | Risk:
Gaps in temperature logs or undocumented deviations. <br/> Action: Implement automated
temperature monitoring with alerts. Ensure SOP for excursion management is followed. |
5.2 Mock Inspection & Staff Training
A mock inspection will be conducted at a high-enrollment or high-risk site to test our systems
and prepare the team.
Practice Inspector Questions for Site Staff:
"Please walk me through the consenting process for subject 001-005."
"Show me the source document for the primary endpoint for subject 001-010."
"There was an SAE reported on [Date]. Please provide the complete SAE report, PI signature,
and proof of submission. Explain the timeline from site awareness to sponsor notification."
"How do you ensure the pharmacy is dispensing according to the randomization schedule
without unblinding site staff?"
6.0 Tactical Inspection Management
Upon notification of an inspection, the following plan will be executed to ensure a smooth and
professional process.
Designate an Inspection Room: A secure conference room with internet, a printer/scanner, and
proximity to document storage will serve as the inspector's base of operations.
Assign Key Roles:
Host/Facilitator: The single point of contact for the inspector; manages all requests.
Scribe: Documents all requests, conversations, and records provided to the inspector.
Runner(s): Retrieves documents and provides them to the Host for review before they are given
to the inspector.
Subject Matter Experts (SMEs): PI, data manager, pharmacist, etc., available on-call to address
specific questions.
Prepare All Staff:
Conduct a pre-inspection briefing covering key principles: answer only the question asked, be
truthful, state "I don't know" rather than guessing, and know who to refer questions to.
Role-play practice questions with anticipated interviewees.
Manage Document Requests:
Never provide direct, uncontrolled access to the eTMF or EDC.
Fulfill requests by providing read-only access to specific documents or certified copies.
Review every document for completeness and to ensure no out-of-scope information is visible
before handover.
Establish an Escalation Plan:
If a potentially significant finding is identified, the Host will immediately and discreetly notify
pre-defined Sponsor (BioNova) and CRO (ClinEdge) contacts.
7.0 Post-Inspection Response & CAPA Management
A timely, thorough, and systemic response to any findings is critical for demonstrating
accountability and commitment to quality.
Acknowledge Findings: Thank the inspector during the closing meeting. Ask clarifying questions
if necessary, but do not debate the findings.
Assemble Response Team: Immediately convene the core team to perform a root cause
analysis for each observation.
Draft Written Response: The formal response, due within 15 business days, must address each
observation individually using the CAPA format below.
CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action) Response Template
Observation #1: [Restate the observation exactly as written on the Form 483 or equivalent]
Response:
Root Cause Analysis: A brief, thorough analysis of why the deficiency occurred (e.g., process
failure, lack of training, unclear SOP, human error).
Corrective Action (Immediate Containment): What has already been done to fix the specific
instance(s) cited.
Example: "The PI reviewed and signed the report for SAE-003 on [Date]. A certified copy is
attached as Appendix A."
Preventive Action (Systemic Solution): What will be done to prevent this issue from recurring
across the entire study. This is the most critical part of the response.
Example: "Site SOP-05 'Safety Reporting' has been updated (Version 3.0) to require a
designated backup to deliver all SAE reports to the PI within 24 hours of site awareness. All site
research staff were retrained on the new SOP on [Date]. Training records are attached as
Appendix B."
Effectiveness Check: How and when you will verify that the preventive action is working.
Example: "The monitor will review the SAE signature tracking log at every monitoring visit for
the next 6 months to ensure 100% compliance with the updated SOP."
Timeline for Completion: Provide a specific date for the full implementation of all preventive
actions.
Smart Alerts
Refresh
Of course. I have reviewed and polished the provided document to enhance its structure, clarity,
and professional tone, ensuring it is a robust and actionable specification.
The original document was already very strong. The key changes I made were:
Removed Introductory Meta-Commentary: The document now starts directly with the
specification, making it more formal.
Sharpened Language: Replaced some descriptive phrases with more direct, active language for
a more concise and authoritative tone.
Improved Formatting: Used consistent bolding, sub-bullets, and blockquotes to make key
information and examples easier to scan and digest.
Standardized Terminology: Ensured consistent naming conventions for alerts and roles
throughout the document.
Enhanced Actionability: Refined the examples and action steps to be even more explicit.
Here is the polished version:
Smart Alerts System Specification: Protocol LUMA-201-NSCLC-P3
Document Version: 1.0 Date: October 26, 2023
1.0 Introduction & Core Philosophy
The LUMA-201 Smart Alerts system is a dynamic, risk-based oversight engine designed to
serve as the proactive "nervous system" for the clinical trial. Its primary objective is to transition
the study team from reactive problem-solving to proactive risk mitigation and predictive trial
management.
The system detects potential compliance and operational issues before they escalate, ensuring
the trial remains audit-ready and adheres to FDA, EMA, and ICH-GCP standards. This
specification details the integrated alert system, which leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to
analyze data from the eTMF, CTMS, Medidata Rave (EDC), and site communications.
2.0 Governance & Oversight
A robust governance plan ensures the system remains effective, relevant, and compliant
throughout the trial lifecycle.
2.1 System Mandate & Objectives:
Provide predictive insights into emerging operational and compliance risks.
Ensure real-time adherence to ICH-GCP E6(R2) principles, specifically Sponsor oversight.
Protect patient safety by identifying leading indicators of potential harm.
Safeguard data integrity by cross-validating inputs from disparate systems.
2.2 Governance & Ownership:
Alert Owner: Head of Clinical Operations, BioNova.
Alert Review Committee (ARC): A cross-functional team (Regulatory, ClinOps, Data
Management, Medical Monitor) that meets quarterly to review alert performance, tune
thresholds, and approve new alerts.
System Administrator: Designated technical lead from ClinEdge Global.
2.3 Risk-Based Prioritization Framework:
Critical (Level 1): Poses a direct and immediate risk to patient safety, data integrity, or regulatory
standing (e.g., use of wrong ICF, potential unblinding). Requires action within 24 hours.
High (Level 2): A major deviation that could lead to an audit finding if unaddressed (e.g., missing
PI signature on an SAE, expired IRB approval). Requires action within 72 hours.
Medium (Level 3): A potential compliance or operational issue that requires attention (e.g.,
query aged >30 days, enrollment lag). Requires action within 7 days.
Low (Informational): A trend indicator or minor process improvement opportunity (e.g.,
document nearing 90-day expiration).
3.0 System Architecture & Workflow
The system operates on a continuous, four-stage workflow:
Data Ingestion & Monitoring: The system continuously monitors data from key sources:
eTMF: Document uploads, versions, dates, and signatures.
CTMS: Site status, milestone tracking, and monitoring visit reports.
EDC (Medidata Rave): Patient data entry, query status, and event dates.
Site Communications: Emails and logs scanned for deviation keywords.
AI Analysis Engine: A central AI core uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and pattern
recognition to analyze ingested data for specific triggers and anomalies.
Risk Detection & Alert Generation: When a potential issue is identified, the Risk Identification
Module evaluates it against the predefined logic in the Alert Taxonomy (Section 4.0) and
generates a specific, categorized alert.
Action & Resolution: Generated alerts are routed to a central dashboard, prioritized by severity,
and assigned to the appropriate personnel. Actions are taken, logged, and the alert is resolved
within the system, creating a feedback loop for continuous learning.

4.0 Alert Taxonomy & Logic Library
Alerts are categorized by function and intelligence level.
A. Predictive & Proactive Alerts
Alert ID P-01: IRB Expiration Risk Alert
Functionality: Tracks IRB/EC approval expiration dates for all 25 sites.
Smart Logic: Compares the upcoming expiration date with the historical average IRB renewal
cycle time for that country/region. It also checks the eTMF for a submission package logged as
"In Progress."
Example Scenario: An EU site's IRB approval expires in 75 days. The average renewal cycle for
EU sites is 60 days, and no submission package is logged in the eTMF. Prediction: 30% risk of
lapse. A Medium alert is sent to the CRA to initiate contact. The alert escalates to High at 45
days pre-expiry if the package is still not logged.
Regulatory Justification: ICH-GCP E6(R2) 3.1.4; 21 CFR 56.109(f).
Alert ID P-02: Site Enrollment Velocity Alert
Functionality: Compares real-time screening and enrollment data against site-specific targets
and study-wide averages.
Smart Logic: Analyzes screen-fail rates and screening velocity to predict if a site will miss its
"Last Patient In" (Mar 2026) milestone.
Example Scenario: Site 003 (UCSF) has a screen-fail rate of 75% compared to the study
average of 50%. Its current velocity projects a 5-week delay. A Medium alert is sent to the
ClinEdge Global Project Manager to investigate potential issues with protocol interpretation or
patient population mismatch.
Regulatory Justification: Adherence to trial timelines is an ethical commitment (Declaration of
Helsinki) and a regulatory expectation.
Alert ID P-03: Adverse Event Pattern Recognition Alert
Functionality: Monitors AE logs in the EDC for anomalous clusters or trends.
Smart Logic: The AI flags statistically significant clusters of specific AEs (by type, grade, or
timing) at a single site or across a region that deviate from the study-wide baseline.
Example Scenario: A cluster of five Grade 2 "Rash" AEs is logged in Arm A at a single site
within 10 days. This anomalous pattern may indicate a dosing error or concomitant medication
issue. A High alert is sent to the Medical Monitor and lead CRA for immediate investigation.
Regulatory Justification: Proactive safety signal detection as part of Sponsor oversight
(ICH-GCP 5.0).
B. Data Integrity & Quality Cross-System Alerts
Alert ID DI-01: ICF Version Mismatch Alert
Functionality: Scans all newly uploaded Informed Consent Forms (ICFs).
Smart Logic: Cross-references the [Consent Date] entered in Medidata Rave with the [ICF
Version Effective Date] documented in the eTMF for that specific site.
Example Scenario: Site 003 uploads a signed ICF. The AI detects the Consent Date is prior to
the effective date of the current approved version (v2.0). A Critical alert is triggered, preventing
the use of an outdated consent form.
Regulatory Justification: Enforces ICH-GCP 4.8.11; 21 CFR 50.27.
Alert ID DI-02: Unblinded Data Access Anomaly Alert
Functionality: Monitors access logs for sensitive, unblinded datasets.
Smart Logic: Flags any attempt by a user account tagged with a 'Blinded' role (e.g., CRA, PI) to
access a folder or report tagged as 'Unblinded.'
Example Scenario: During an interim analysis, a CRA's credentials are used to attempt access
to the unblinded analysis dataset. A Critical alert is sent immediately to the Head of ClinOps
(BioNova) and the System Administrator.
Regulatory Justification: Protects trial integrity and prevents bias (ICH-GCP 4.7).
Alert ID DI-03: Query Aging Alert
Functionality: Monitors the age of all open data queries in Medidata Rave.
Smart Logic: Generates an alert for any query unresolved for >30 days. Escalates queries aged
>60 days.
Example Scenario: A query on a discrepant Progression-Free Survival (PFS) assessment date
has been open for 32 days. A Medium alert is sent to the assigned CRA to facilitate resolution,
ensuring clean data for the July 2026 database lock.
Regulatory Justification: Upholds data integrity principles (ICH-GCP 5.1.3, ALCOA+).
C. Regulatory & Safety Adherence Alerts
Alert ID R-01: Intelligent SAE Reporting Clock
Functionality: Manages the 24-hour Serious Adverse Event (SAE) reporting timeline.
Smart Logic: The reporting clock starts from the [Site Awareness Date/Time] field in the EDC,
not the data entry time. The system also checks if the required PI signature field is populated.
Example Scenario: An SAE is logged with a site awareness time of 18 hours ago, but the PI
signature field remains blank. A High alert is sent to the Site Coordinator and PI. At T-2 hours
(22 hours post-awareness), if still unsigned, the alert escalates to Critical and is sent to the CRA
and Project Manager.
Regulatory Justification: Supports ICH-GCP 4.11.1; 21 CFR 312.62(b).
Alert ID R-02: Missing PI Signature on Critical Documents
Functionality: Uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to scan for signatures on key
documents upon upload to the eTMF.
Smart Logic: Identifies designated signature blocks on high-risk documents (e.g., SAE reports,
Protocol Deviation forms, Form FDA 1572) and flags any document where the block is empty.
Example Scenario: An SAE follow-up report is uploaded for a patient in Arm A. The system
detects the field for Dr. Susan Han's signature is blank. A High alert is generated.
Regulatory Justification: Mandates PI oversight and sign-off (ICH-GCP 4.11.1).
5.0 Alert Action & Escalation Protocol
An alert is only effective if it drives a clear and timely action.
5.1 Alert Delivery & Required Actions: Each alert will be delivered via a role-based dashboard,
email, and/or SMS and will include a clear, actionable directive.
Example Notification for "Outdated ICF" Alert (DI-01): Subject: CRITICAL ALERT: Outdated ICF
Used at Site 003
Body: Site 003 has used ICF v1.1 for patient screening.
Required Action:
Immediately quarantine the signed form.
Re-consent the patient using the current approved ICF v2.0.
Document this event as a protocol deviation and implement a CAPA.
Confirm all old versions of the ICF have been removed from the site.
5.2 Escalation Rules: Alerts are automatically escalated if not acknowledged or resolved within
their designated timeframes.
High/Critical Alerts: If not acknowledged by the primary recipient (e.g., Site Coordinator) within
12 hours, the alert is escalated to the CRA and CRO Project Manager. If unresolved after 48
hours, it is escalated to the Sponsor's Head of Clinical Operations and the Coordinating
Investigator.
Medium Alerts: If not acknowledged within 3 days, the alert is escalated to the primary
recipient's line manager.
6.0 Continuous Improvement & System Learning
The AI system is designed to learn and improve over the course of the trial.
User Feedback Loop: When closing an alert, the user will classify it as "Helpful & Resolved" or
"False Positive." This feedback is essential for training the AI model.
System Learning: A high rate of "False Positive" flags for a specific check allows the ARC to
tune the algorithm to reduce noise. "Helpful" feedback reinforces the algorithm's accuracy.
Monthly Alert Effectiveness Reports: A dashboard will be generated for BioNova and ClinEdge
Global leadership, summarizing key performance indicators:
Total alerts by category and severity.
Mean time to resolution (MTTR).
Top 3 recurring compliance risks across all 25 sites.
"False Positive" rate, indicating areas for AI model refinement.
7.0 Validation & Testing Plan
As a GxP system, the Smart Alerts system will be formally validated to ensure it is audit-ready.
7.1 Installation & Operational Qualification (IQ/OQ): Formal documentation of the system's
configuration and testing of its core functionality (e.g., data connections, alert delivery).
7.2 Performance Qualification (PQ) & User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
A UAT script will be created with test cases for each specific alert.
Example Test Case: "Create a test patient in the EDC at Site 003, consented with an outdated
ICF version. Confirm Alert DI-01 fires correctly to the designated test user within 5 minutes."
All testing results, including screenshots and electronic sign-offs, will be documented to ensure
the system complies with 21 CFR Part 11 requirements for electronic records and signatures.
