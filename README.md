# ClinOps - Agentic Clinical Trial Project Manager



  
**Problem Statement:** Clinical trials involve doctors, coordinators, and data teams working across many apps (email, spreadsheets, document portals). Because no single tool “understands” the trial plan or the research rules, teams can miss steps like using an outdated consent form or forgetting a signature. That creates delays, stress, and expensive, last-minute audit work.

**Solution:** A project manager with a built-in helper (“agent”) that reads the trial plan, lays out milestones automatically, tracks progress, and gently prevents common mistakes. Think of it as Google Maps for a trial project: it suggests turns, warns about hazards, and keeps a record of where you went. It does not make medical or legal decisions—people do. It simply helps the team stay organized and ready for inspection.

**Objective:** Show that the tool is usable and helpful in a short pilot: (1) correctly turns a trial plan into a workable timeline, (2) cuts the time to assemble an audit folder, (3) catches common mistakes (like outdated consent forms) before they happen, and (4) is adopted by coordinators and managers (used at least weekly) with positive feedback.
